The ghost will talk every 3 minutes. When a story finishes, you can use the "Pick up a new shell" button in the menu to start the next story. When no story is active, the "Pick up a new shell" button will be highlighted, and short idle dialogues will play.

You cannot prompt for new dialogues until all stories are complete. Please allow the ghost time to talk on its own. (Though, you can adjust the talk rate if desired, but it is recommended to leave it at 3 minutes.)

After all stories are complete, you will get the ability to pick which story to replay. You can also use the "Next" button in the menu (or the "T" button on the keyboard) to play the next part of the story immediately.
